This is an example on how to integrate knovajs lib with angular. 

Actually, its quite easy but I didn't find any good solution on internet, so I just use the typescript way to do it.

no need to make a new module for angular or some weird solution. 

It MAY BE NOT the best solution, so if you think there is a better one, file in issues I'll fix it.

I'm new to Typescript / Angular / and all web stuff, so be careful on this solution.

To understand this, 

you MUST have some knowledge of Angular (https://angular.io/)

You MUST have some knowledge of TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

Please read the playme component, the code can tell its story.

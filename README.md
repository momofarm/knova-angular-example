This is an example on how to integrate knovajs lib with angular. 

Actually, its quite easy but I didn't find any good solution on internet, so I just use the typescript way to do it.

It MAY BE NOT the best solution, so if you think there is a better one, file in issues I'll fix it.

I'm new to Typescript / Angular / and all web stuff, so be careful on this solution.
